# Xinder

This is a fresh take on Tinder, a very basic take on it at that, only using HTML, CSS & FontAwsome.

The assets can be found: [here](https://github.com/reginaldop/tinder-html-css), but I used my own.

## Demo

There is a demo on this project! and I'm not being indirect, here is the link: click [here](https://l-xdt.github.io/xinder/)


## Features

- Uses FontAwsome for 3 icons.

- Mostly reliant on Images and can be used offline.

- You are in control of the project.

- There are many factores to change: like the color palette.

- **PS:** There is a lot in the little features, so I can't say a lot on it currently.


## Screenshots

**Written in plain HTML & CSS, and uses a little bit of font awsome. I don't know about the rest.**

## FAQ

**Now for my favourite, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yes, why of-course! That is why we make stuff like this and publish it onto the internet, for you to try, fail and correct your mistakes, using our code as a place of refrence.

#### Can I hot this, if I can, how?

Yes, you can! With my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP! Since I have explained it 22 times (I'm not counting), I'm not kiddding, but we can skip the explanation since you know the drill.

So! Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to the server. XAMPP (of-course)! And if you are struggling about you can start hosting with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff).

And if you truly trust your web skills, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy) to self-host a domain.
